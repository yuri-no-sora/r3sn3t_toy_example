# ðŸ§  r3sn3t_toy_example: An Educational ResNet Model

This repository is dedicated to understanding the architecture of a **Deep Residual Network (ResNet)**, modeled after its successful application in **differential cryptanalysis** (specifically, the work against the Speck-32/64 cipher). This is a conceptual implementation designed for hands-on learning.

**ðŸš¨ Note:** I'm using this project purely for **educational purposes** to explore deep learning architectures and how **Residual Connections** are applied to bit-level data.

## ðŸš€ Getting Started

To follow along with the interactive notebook, you need to install the essential deep learning libraries:

```bash
pip install tensorflow keras numpy jupyter
